# TF-IDF-and-NLP-to-create-a-WordCloud
In this project, I will fit a TF-IDF model on a text dataset and use TF-IDF weights to create a WordCloud that represent word importance. 

# Understanding the Project: 

Term Frequency Document Inverse Frequency (TF-DF) is 

#Steps taken in this Project: 
ask 1 - Load a JSON dataset in Python

Task 2 - Clean the dataset

Task 3 - Creating a function to remove word encodings

Task 4 - Lemmatize the text

Task 5 - Fit TF-IDF model

Task 6 - Create a Wordcloud

  Obtaining TF-IDF weights for word pairings and feeding those weights into a word cloud generater which will create an image, that better visualizes word importance. trhtgt
